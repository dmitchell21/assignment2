        <p>
            This is my group project 'Knightways,' an app that
            helped students navigate the main UCF campus. The app 
            included a map of campus, weather forecasts, and an account
            system that allowed direct messaging between users.
        </p>

        <p>Through this project, I learned key principles of user interface design and human–computer interaction. I was responsible for designing the app’s frontend UI, focusing on usability, layout, and user-friendly navigation. This project helped me understand how thoughtful interface design improves accessibility and overall user experience, even without directly programming the application.</p>
