            This is my 'Petboarding' database that I created for a class.
            This database manages a pet care business by tracking clients, pets, employees, schedules, and services. It links pets to their respective services, calculates costs, and connects everything back to the correct client for smooth operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            By creating this database, I learned how to design and structure a relational database using SQL. I gained experience organizing tables, defining relationships, and writing queries to manage data efficiently. This project helped me understand how database structure supports real-world business operations.
